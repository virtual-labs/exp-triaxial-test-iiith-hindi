			"question": "2. A conventional drained triaxial compression test was conducted on a normally consolidated clay sample under an effective confining pressure (σ<sub>3</sub>) of 200 kPa. The deviator stress (σ<sub>d</sub>) at failure was found to be 400 kPa. An identical specimen of the same clay sample is isotropically consolidated to a confining pressure (σ<sub>3</sub>) of 200 kPa and subjected to standard undrained triaxial compression test. If the deviator stress at failure (σ<sub>d</sub>') is 150 kPa, the pore pressure developed in kPa is ____.",

				"a": "In both consolidated drained (CD) test as well as consolidated undrained (CU) test, c = 0. We first obtain σ<sub>1</sub> as σ<sub>d</sub> + σ<sub>3</sub>. Then we obtain Φ from the formula: σ<sub>1</sub> = σ<sub>3</sub> * tan<sup>2</sup> (45 + Φ / 2) + 2 * c * tan (45 + Φ / 2). Next we obtain the pore pressure U by substituting σ<sub>1</sub>' = σ<sub>3</sub> + σ<sub>d</sub>' - U and σ<sub>3</sub>' = σ<sub>3</sub> - U in the formula: σ<sub>1</sub>' = σ<sub>3</sub>' * tan<sup>2</sup> (45 + Φ / 2) + 2 * c * tan (45 + Φ / 2).",
